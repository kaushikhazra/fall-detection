<h1>About This Project</h1>
<h2>Fall Detection System</h2>
<p>
    <i>A BSc. Computer Science Final Project for University of London</i>
</p>

<p>
    According to the World Health Organization, falling-related injuries are a 
    significant problem worldwide. An estimated 684 thousand people die from falls globally, 
    of which 80% are in low and middle-income countries
</p>

<p>
    The above numbers can be significantly reduced if we can detect 
    the fall in time and provide medical attention to the victim. 
    However, it is very hard to predict when and where a person will 
    fall and if there will be any person to aid with the incident. 
    To solve this problem, many solutions have been proposed to automatically 
    detect a fall and alert the necessary people to avoid fatality.
</p>

<p>
    There are many such fall detection systems available in the market, 
    like bracelets, belts, pendants, and many more, that can be used to 
    efficiently detect a fall. However, they come with their own problems, 
    like privacy invasion issues or discomfort from wearing them. On the 
    other hand, there are many solutions available for camera-based home 
    security, and they all perform quite well in detecting moving objects, 
    but detecting falls is available in very limited systems.
</p>

<p>
    My idea is to build a non-invasive fall detection system that is 
    available as a part of a camera-based home security solution.
</p>

<p>
    The final product will be a camera-based system that can monitor a closed space, 
    like a room, corridor, or an office space, detect movement, and detect the fall 
    of a person that occurs in the observed zone. The system will be capable of 
    sending alerts when a fall happens and recording the video of the fall.
</p>

<p>
    For this project, I have planned to use an infrared camera. An infrared camera 
    will enable the solution to see in low light conditions.
</p>

<p>
    I have decided to build the solution on a Raspberry Pi 4B platform. 
    This will give me enough computing power to run a neural network that can detect falls.
</p>

<p>
    In this project, I have decided to use the userâ€™s home Wi-Fi network to 
    communicate any information, like alerts or viewing an incident using an 
    onboard web application. For communication, I had the choice of using cell 
    phone-based technology, like a USB 4G dongle. However, Raspberry Pi 4B 
    comes with a built-in Wi-Fi adapter, which I have used for the wireless 
    network and took advantage of the built-in feature.
</p>

<p>
    I have decided to build this solution entirely using Python. There are 
    two reasons why I chose Python: first, any Raspberry Pi is well capable 
    of running Python applications, and second, most of the machine learning 
    algorithms are available in Python.
</p>

<p>
    For the fall detection, I will use OpenCV as a computer vision framework 
    because it has many built-in libraries that can reduce my effort. For the 
    user interface, I will use Flask. This framework can be used in an embedded 
    environment like Raspberry Pi to show a web UI.
